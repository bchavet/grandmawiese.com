About 2/3 c. peanut butter
60 buttery flavored round or oval crackers
1 tub (16 ounces) chocolate ready-to-spread frosting

Spread peanut butter on each of 30 crackers; top with remaining
crackers.  Heat frosting over low heat, stirring constantly,
just until melted (do not overcook).  Using two forks, dip each
cracker sandwich into frosting, coating completely; place on
waxed paper.  Let dry uncovered 8 hours.  Store loosely covered.

30 cookies
