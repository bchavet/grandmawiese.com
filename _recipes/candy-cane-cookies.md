<pre>
(This is doubled from the original recipe)

1 c. butter
1 c. shortening
1 c. powdered sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp. vanilla
1 tsp. peppermint flavoring
5 c. flour
2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. red food coloring (for red batch)

Mix thoroughly butter, shortening, powdered sugar, eggs, and
flavorings.  Blend in flour and salt.

Make one batch plain and add food coloring to a second batch.

For each candy cane, shape 1 teaspoon dough from each color
into a 4-inch rope.  Place the ropes side by side and press
together lightly; twist.  Place on a greased baking sheet and
curve the top of each twist to form the handle of the cane.

Bake about 9 minutes or until set and very light brown.  Mix
candy and granulated sugar; sprinkle on the hot cookies and remove
from baking sheet.
