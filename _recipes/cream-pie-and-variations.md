Gradually add 6 Tbsp white sugar (2 Tbsp at a time), beating
thoroughly after each addition until stiff peaks form. (Test
meringue mixture to see if sugar is dissolved by--rubbing a bit
of meringue between thumb and forefinger.  If it isn't grainy,
the meringue is ready to use.  Continue beating if it is grainy-
feeling.)

Spread meringue over filling, making sure to cover pie crust edges.
Swirl or pull up points of meringue with back of spoon to make
attractive.  Bake 10 minutes at 400°, until golden brown.
